===========================================

Consider a square board of size N. Each cell can either be empty or be occupied by a ship. The position of a ship is defined by three parameters: an x-coordinate, a y-coordinate and an orientation (north, east, south, west).

Once the initial state of the board is set up, any number of operations can occur. There are two types of operations:

-- Move a ship
Specified by an initial coordinate and a series of movements which can be move forward (in the
direction that ship is facing), rotate left, rotate right.
A ship can navigate through an occupied cell. However, two ships cannot occupy the same cell at the
end of a move operation.

Ship cannot move out of the board ( eg. move on (0, 0, S)) in case one of the operations on the ship is illigal, ships stayes without any change

-- Shoot down a ship
Specified by an x- and y-coordinate. If the cell is occupied, that ship is sunk and the cell can
be occupied by another ship. If there is no ship, nothing happens.


===========================================

- Single ship creation within 1x1 board boundaries with directions: N, E, S, W.
- Illegal single ship creation outside 1x1 board boundaries.
- Illegal single ship creation outside 3x3 board boundaries.
- Ship rotation of 360 degrees (1 full rotation) to the right and to the left.
- Ship rotation of 720 degrees (2 full rotation) to the right and to the left.
- Ship rotation and single movement to a new location.
- Ship rotation and movement with mix of multiple commands.
- Multiple ship creation in one input line.
- Ship shoot down.
- Illegal ship movement outside board's boundaries.
- Illegal ship movement outside board's boundaries to legal destination location which is within the board boundaries.
- Illegal ship movement to location of other ships. 
- Illegal ship shootdown outside board's boundaries. 
- Ship movement over others ships.
- Ship shoot down and attempt to rotation and movement of the sunk ship.
- Attempt on ship shoot down on location without a ship.
- Movement or rotation command for a location without a ship.
- Movement ships to the same location and shoot down (with the same direction).

Input file format:

The first line contains the size of the board. 
The second line contains a list of
coordinate-and-orientation tuples (initial position of the ships).
 Any subsequent lines are
operations: shoot operations (simply coordinates) and move operations (coordinates to specify
the ship to be considered and a sequence of 'L' (rotate left), 'R' (rotate right) and 'M' (move)).

Output file format:

First lines with existing ships: Ordered by x field first and then y. (eg (0,1),(0,2),(1,0))
Each line will contain ships coordinates and it's orientation in format (x, y, or).  
After will follow lines with sunk ships with their last position (x, y, or) SUNK
